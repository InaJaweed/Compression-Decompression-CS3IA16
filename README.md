# Image_Compression-CS3IA16

## Overview
This project aims to explore various image compression techniques to reduce the size of natural images while preserving quality. It includes implementations of compression and decompression algorithms in MATLAB.

## Project Details
- **Course**: Image Analysis Third-Year Module
- **Language**: Matlab

## Features
- Load and display original images
- Compress images using different techniques
- Save compressed images to memory
- Read compressed images from memory
- Decompress images
- Compute and display compression ratio (CR) statistics

## Compression Techniques
The following compression techniques were explored:
- Imwrite
- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
- Run-Length Encoding (RLE)
- JPEG Compression
